##  Description 
This node.js application streamlines the creation of professional README.md documents by guiding developers through a series of prompts via the inquirer package. With this tool, developers can quickly generate README.md files without sacrificing valuable time better spent on creating and maintaining their applications. The application collects user input such as name, application title, description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, test instructions, preferred licensing, GitHub handle, and primary email. The output is a well-organized and comprehensive README.md file that reflects the user's inputs. Through the development of this application, I gained a deeper understanding of backend development problem-solving without a graphical user interface. I also became proficient in importing libraries such as inquirer and file system, utilizing prompts within the command line, and utilizing ES6 syntax such as template literals and arrow functions.

## Technologies Used

The current undertaking is enabled by Node.js v16, and leverages the inquirer v8.2.4 package manager for Node.js, alongside the file system module also available through the Node package manager.

## Installation

Clone the repo: git clone  git@github.com:Slfdspln/readme-generator.git

Open in VS Code. If you do not have VS code you must install it.

## Features

This application offers a range of features designed to enhance the user's experience in generating a professional README.md document directly from the command line. By responding to a series of prompts about their application, the user can create a markdown file containing important information about their project. Notably, the README.md file includes a licensing badge placed at the top of the page, which reflects the user's desired coverage under a specific license. Additionally, the file features a table of contents that is linked to the different sections of the README.md document, enabling users to quickly navigate to their desired content. Finally, the generated README.md file includes a section at the bottom where users can find the author's GitHub and email contact details. Clicking on these links will redirect the user to the relevant platform or pre-populate an email addressed to the author.
